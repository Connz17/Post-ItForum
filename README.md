## **Project Overview**

Our team took inspiration from discussion platforms like Reddit and Quora for our full-stack application, which enables users to explore various spaces and topics of their interest, post content, give likes, and comment. Logged-in users have greater privileges and can engage more with other users than non-logged-in users, who are presented with a limited page.



### ***Methodology***

We have been used Scrum for this project. Reason we have chosen this as it is based on good communication, collaboration between team members and stakeholders. Also, the ability to be flexible and respond quickly to change. The basic building blocks of Agile development are iterations: Each one of them includes planning, analysis, design, development, and testing.

For versional control, we have used GitHub

### ***Roles and responsibilities***

Everyone has contributed equally, making sure when we distributed the work, everyone was comfortable with the work they were given and were given the needed support when needed to meet our end goal.

### ***Purpose***

We are building this product to showcase our skills we have acquired through our own projects or through the bootcamp. The project is a messaging forum where users are able to create an account and post message threads and other signed-up users can interact with that message thread, like comments/posts, comment on other users posts, reply to comments delete and update comments. Be able to use the CRUD operations.

#### ***Wireframe***

Our wireframe shows the landing page for a user who does not have an account with us. Beginning design without the additional pages.

Our first page to reflect our wireframe.

***HTML***

We used HTML to populate the text on the page 

<img src = html.png>

***CSS***

We designed our page utilising selectors to manipulate the page and text, making declarations to assign values to properties. For instance, grid, flex, border radius and more.

***Javascript***

We used the fetch function to replace HTML standard data with data populated in a json file.
