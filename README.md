# **Project Overview**

Our team took inspiration from discussion platforms like Reddit and Quora for our full-stack application, which enables users to explore various spaces and topics of their interest, post content, give likes, and comment. Logged-in users have greater privileges and can engage more with other users than non-logged-in users, who are presented with a limited page.
